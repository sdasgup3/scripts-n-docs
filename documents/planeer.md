-----------------------------------------

## Important stoke function
 - specgen_is_base
 - List of system/imm instr
   - ~/Github/master_stoke/src/validator/strata_support.cc

## Todo

- For the following report to strata people
```
a - a != 0 as a cold be NaN
A +- 0 != A
0 + A != A
```
- vpbroadcastb_ymm_xmm simplification helps in getting rid of uifs ... talk about the simplificatiom lemma
  - checin all the formula and then do the simplification to find which one got optimized.
- Paper
  - Problem with secondary searhces in involving UIFs.
  - what about the baseInstructions: should we have our own or just take it from stoke
  - K better than strata because of the ease of testing uifs
  - Problem with secondary searches involving uifs.
  - Strata Vs K: For exapme as in pdepl/q we have to write the ast of the result state,where as in K we have to mention the executon semantic. Much easier.
- Test the starta formula
  - Test the mutiple output instruction with same registers
- Port all the tested starta formula to K
- Fix af
- Plan for implemnting the uifs
- Test the lemmas using rise for fun: like add_single(0||x, 0) == 0  Also write about  the importance of this lemma in simplification.
- Implement "schedule insutcructions" + still unsuported + "huge ones pdepl/q"
- Check if vmovmskpd_r32_xmm is caught in the test as it is not generated in stoke handler. So implement it.
- Test the ones which are manually implemented in K.
- Is the semantics of sal/shr/sar in base instr consistent with what we get from stoke.
- Undef
  - kompile: are undef represented correctly
  - - Test shlq_r64_cl using strata handler : what is the bahaviour when the udef is triggered. also the z3 test didnt pass for OF. why: formulation of undef is wrong
- Test the rules in K. Important for
  - rorate
  - implemented in K only
  - uifs

## Important Points
- Uses the tc same as the final strata tc
- Use the pattern in the stratified set to feed the search pool.
- instructions containing UIF are never testing in stoke whereas we can test it.
- Our implementation of semantics tested all the base instructions throughly
-  Individual imeediates formulas might have uifs but the generic formula could be very without them.

## base sets
- Base has ymm; Target has xmm
```
vmovaps_xmm_xmm
vmovupd_xmm_xmm
128<->64
vzeroall
vmovapd_xmm_xmm
vmovdqu_xmm_xmm
vminpd_ymm_ymm_ymm
vmovups_xmm_xmm
vmaxps_xmm_xmm_xmm
```

## Stoke Queries
- How hold out testing is different from make test
- How to generate the meta json File
- Can we use some information from the meta json file to expediate an already stratified instructions.
- How the evaluate is called.
- Can we add base instr while strata is running
- The way I am running tools is as follows:
  - Add the targets in remaining_goals
  - Add the entire base set in success
  - initial_goal file does not matter
  - Redusing the number of success instructions: Is it useful.
  - continue just appends to the log files: Just not continue the search or verify wher it is left off.
  - Why the ones with UIF taking huge time and all the equiv classes are of length 1.
  - InitialSeatch Vs Secondary Search
  - Say instr 2 needs instr 1 for stratification. WIll they be fired symultaneoulsy !!
  - Can we get rid of initial search failure using a small but infired base set.
  - How cleanup help
  - How it knows that some runs are pending
  - Who populates the scores.json
  - How to instruct stoke search to always include one element of base set in the search.
  - How to avoid adding the v-version of
    ```
    add_opcode("vpsllvq", [] (SymBitVector a, SymBitVector b) {}
    ```
    Note that thei sopcode does not have a non v-version.
  - What is the criteria of stop geenrating any more seqs.
    - handleTaskResult in Driver.scala
  - What is secondary search with a goal.

## Troubleshoot
  - Check the name of the function or the token, if the name mismatch happen the weird error may happen
    - For example, Defining combineNTo2N and using combineNto2N
  - Stuck rule
    - check the require
  - Check the sort name Rh vs RH
  - look for extractMInt as if need its 2 and 3rd arg to be concrete Int during kprove
  - Check if the config file contain the regstate initialized. This is required for running tests.
  - extractMask stucks if bitwidthmint is not defned for its args.

## Query to Strata
- why they didnt test the base formula
- https://github.com/StanfordPL/stoke/issues/752
- Who generates the function as they also seem to be stratified generated.
- How do u generate such small formulas
- In the excel sheet who gives the Properties.
- How to learn the read.write set of instrctions.
  - Are they stored. (Yes, in the excel sheet)
- Get a rough count of instructions. ~ 600
-  How the formula are stored in stoke as list of 86 instrs or an smt formula.
- How are you genering the formula from a seq of instructions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Which insructions are in strata one/two/....
- What is in data-regs/functions: how are they created
- What is in data-regs/instructions : what they are meant for: To get the read-write set.
  - Why the count is not complete, are they autogenerated.
- In case we want to just use the learned formula, how we can get that from stoke.
  - Is there any equivalent to stoke debug citcuit
- What is strata_programs in stoke directorty
-
- ~~Where are the generalized formulas~~
    - The generalization is done to other registers and immediates,
- How to learn the formula for instructions with immediates which does not have a regiter variant and imm is more that 8 bits.
- Due to its stochastic nature and the large size of the x86-64
ISA, multiple runs of STOKE usually lead to distinct syn- thesized programs. Does that mean that different strata runs can give diffent formulas.
- Ask Theo: what are the limitations of existing work and the drft copy.
- Location od stoke home grown formulas.
- How to you find the manuals encoding based manual error.
- Are circuit formulas simplified.
- Generating write set of instr.
  - Does 3.4.1 hint towards that.
- ~~In circuit why we have many version of same instrcitions~~
  - There are te 256 varriants of imm instructions.

We distinguish between the  two representations of an assembly language
program: (1) the assembly code obtained directly from a high-level program, say a C program and (2) a representation of the disassembled executable.
The former uses labels as an abstract representation of the memory addresses for both instructions (i.e. L1, L2) and data, whereas the later use absolute address.

We first focus on the later.
The input to our K tool  could be  K memory cell initialized with addresses of instruction/data.
This is not amenable for testing large programs

For that,
The input program to parse could be a  disassembled program  with instructions and data address specified and the parser will load the prhram into a K memory cell at the specified address.

Try to get an exhaustive list of instructions.

## Notes

- In decompilation test
```
Revmg Dowm, Mcsema Up:  test_36 and test_22
Revmg Up, Mcsema D:  test_OOP
```

- Decision to move from
```
<regstate>
  "RAX" |-> (MI1 => MI2)
</regstate>
```
to
```
<regstate> RSMap => updateMap(RSMap,  "RAX" |-> (MI1 |-> MI2 )
</regstate>
```




Problem with first format
1. With

```
<regstate>...
  convToRegKeys(R1) |-> MI1
  convToRegKeys(R2) |-> (MI2 => expr(MI1, MI2))
...</regstate>
```
If R1 == R2 then we get the error on map concatenation with same keys.

Soluntion 1
```
<regstate>
  convToRegKeys(R2) |-> (MI2) RSMap:Map
  =>
  convToRegKeys(R2) |-> expr(MI2, getRegisterValue(R1, RSMap)) RSMap:Map
...</regstate>
```
Note that RSMap exclude key for R2
In case R1==R2
```
getRegisterValue(R1, RSMap) will not have the key for R1 == R2
```

So the idea is somehow we need the whole old map
Solution 2
```
<regstate>
RSMap => updateMap(RSMap,
    convToRegKeys(R2) |-> expr(getRegisterValue(R2), getRegisterValue(R1, RSMap))
    )
</regstate>
```

2. When R1 == R2 in and R1 is read only and R2 is write
```
<regstate>
  convToRegKeys(R1) |-> (MI1)
  convToRegKeys(R2) |-> (MI2 => expr(MI2, MI1))
</regstate>
```
we get the error on map concatenation with same keys
We need is that we need old values of registers (MI1, MI2) to be defined before they are to be used in rewrite rules

In the second format we get the old value as RSMap

3. When R1 != R2 in and R1  R2 are both written
```
<regstate>
  convToRegKeys(R1) |-> (MI1 => expr(MI1, MI2))
  convToRegKeys(R2) |-> (MI2 => expr(MI2, MI1))
</regstate>
```
Then both soln wil workList

2. When R1 == R2 in and R1  R2 are both written
```
<regstate>
  convToRegKeys(R1) |-> (MI1 => expr(MI1, MI2))
  convToRegKeys(R2) |-> (MI2 => expr(MI2, MI1))
</regstate>
```
