 -  There are several variations on RNNs; of relevance is the Long Short-Term
 Memory (LSTM) model, which consists of a standard recurrent neural network
 with memory cells [16] which are well-suited for learning long term
 dependencies.
 - In what follows, we will show the alternative process of behavior
 computation with full precision at machine speeds.
 - Clicking on row one, the incorrect behavior, produces a list of the line numbers of the instructions whose accumulating behavior produces the 90 degree value
